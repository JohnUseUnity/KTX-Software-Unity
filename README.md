This projects provides a C wrapper for [KTX-Software](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software) and a CMake configuration to build native libraries for many platforms.

Those native libraries are used by [KtxUnity](https://github.com/atteneder/KtxUnity), which provides access to KTX files within [Unity](https://unity3d.com)
